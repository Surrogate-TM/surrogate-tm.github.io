<h1>Gumroad</h1>
<p>If the resulting Visio solution is sufficiently universal and can be used many times
without change, I usually publish it at the Gumroad service.</p>
<p>Some of these solutions are paid (usually a very small fee).
Some are distributed using the 0+ method. That is, you can take it for free
or for the price that you think is fair.</p>
<p>There are also things that are sold for free in executable code,
but the paid version additionally contains open source code.
Thus, you can use a fully functional free version and at the same time
you can expand its functionality yourself or change the code to implement
the desired properties.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about using the product or you want to expand its functionality,
you can contact me by email.</p>
<p>Gumroad provides a collection of statistics about product reviews and purchases.
This allows me to understand which things often cause interest
and focus on developing such things. In addition, Gumroad provides many different ways to accept payments.</p>

<p>Below are my products available through Gumroad.</p>
