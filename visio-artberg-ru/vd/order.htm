<h1>How to order</h1>
<h2>General approach</h2>
<p>We communicate by email, discussing the possibility and order of work.
After that, the way of further work will be chosen - Upwork (more formal) or direct contract.</p>
<p>Upwork is good in that it provides proven opportunities for reserving a deposit,
resolving disputes, for the execution process, a diary, etc.
However, it requires significant commission fees.</p>
<p>A direct arrangement saves money, but all the guarantees lie directly on the contracting parties.</p>
<h2>Preliminary preparation</h2>
<p>There are a number of typical questions, the answers to which will help to solve the problem more quickly.</p>
<UL>
<LI>Visio version
<LI>Where the new solution will be used (on one machine, on several machines
within the same enterprise, will be transferred to your customer as part of the product of your development).
<LI>Your knowledge of Visio (for example, I use for drawing, I had to develop smart shapes, there is experience in developing of macros).
<LI>Can you submit a specification of requirements or requirements will need to be coordinated in the development process.
</UL>
