<h1><p align=center>Methods of creation of scaled objects in Visio 2000.</h1><BR>
	<HR WIDTH=75% ALIGN=CENTER COLOR="#6699FF"><BR>
	All objects in Visio 2000, as is known, consist of vectors, but at creation of scaled objects (times so in 20) it is possible to meet the certain difficulties. At creation of the objects I did not use objects of stencils from structure Visio 2000, and used only my own. I not always could foresee simply behaviour of these objects, and at use of the objects I always knew, how they will lead themselves.
	<ol><li>Problems of scaling of objects.<br>
If we shall create object Visio (a rectangular, for example) and we shall apply to it smoothing of corners at reduction of scale the size of this smoothing remains to a constant and does not vary proportionally to the sizes of object.<br>
	<BR><img alt="Smoothing of corners" align=baseline src="../images/pic0201.gif" width=472 height=213><br><BR>
As it to correct. It is necessary to draw a line directly on a rectangular. To allocate them together and to apply to them a command of association <b>Shape>Operations>Union</b>. After that smoothing of corners will be any more property of object Visio, and simply vector object with an opportunity of scaling.
<li>The Problem of scaling of inscriptions.<br>
If we shall create object Visio (a rectangular, for example) and we shall make in it an inscription at reduction of object height of letters, length of an inscription remain constant.<br>
	<BR><img alt="Scaling of an inscription" align=baseline src="../images/pic0202.gif" width=471 height=207><br><BR>
As it to correct. We open CorelDraw. We create in it an inscription the same (!) font (the height of letters does not excite us) and it is copied in the buffer. We insert in Visio. Here this inscription the same vector object which is a subject scaling. We impose an inscription on a source code and we change the sizes up to necessary. Then we place it on object and it is united <b>Shape>Grouping>Group</b>. This group is completely scaled.
<li>The Problem of scaling of lines.<br>
All lines of which objects consist, I do by thickness of 0.01 mm. Why: At the maximal reduction this line all the same will be the most thin, and at a press the printer will make its most thin by the opportunities (it will not try to print a line of 0.01 mm, and will print the with the most thin what in it is incorporated by the driver).<br>
	<BR><img alt="Scaling of a line" align=baseline src="../images/pic0203.gif" width="468" height="318"><br><BR>
Apparently from the top object at its reduction thickness of an internal line is not kept. As it to correct. Replacement of a thick line with a rectangular. The rectangular on a contour of a line is drawn and done black fill (the Important point: disconnect at a rectangular thickness of a line in position <b>None</b>.
<li>The Problem of scaling of vector figures.<br>
Sometimes it is necessary to explain besides inscriptions on objects something figure.<br>
	<BR><img alt="Scaling of a figure" align=baseline src="../images/pic0204.gif" width="469" height="293"><br><BR>
The last way is applied for this purpose. We recreate our figure rectangular objects and we unite in vector object.<br></ol><br>
Further the general advice which I wished to share.
<ol><li>The Sign on diameter in Visio. It there somewhere in stencils is, but sometimes it is required to receive it in sizes. 
The note: the Insert as symbol from Word in Visio will not help. 
Simply in sizes write the letter, and header. Further we allocate only and we choose font Symbols.<br>
	<BR><img alt="Значок диаметра" align=baseline src="../images/pic0205.gif" width="469" height="196"><br><BR><BR>
		<li>Union with a line of any object will transform it to vector object which is scaled.<br>
		<li>It is impossible to unite vector objects (Union-objects, i.e. those which have already united and have made scaled) among themselves. The second object simply will disappear.<br>
		<li>Inserting diameter to object, do a binding of a point of diameter below or above the middle of object. Otherwise at moving object its diameter numerically (but not actually) will change. Especially it concerns lines of fixing.<br>
	<br><img alt="Привязка диаметра" align=baseline src="../images/pic0206.gif" width="469" height="293"><br><br>
<li>Use Shortcut (hot keys) More. To remember them it is not complex, and time helps with work also saves. Creation user " hot keys " was considered in previous article.<br>
<li>If at you the mouse with wheel, Shift+Wheel it to the right-to the left, Ctrl+Wheel this increase or reduction.</ol>
That's all.<BR>
